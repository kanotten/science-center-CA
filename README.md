summary: 

The science center exam assignment, a collaborative effort by Kenneth Sheikh and Patrick RÃ¸ethe, encompasses a website with four main pages and a checkout section. The central theme revolves around space and the universe, evident in the start page's captivating animation of the Earth orbiting the sun. To ensure responsiveness, media queries are employed for various screen sizes, complemented by a dropdown menu. All buttons seamlessly link to their respective pages. Reflecting on the project, the initial planning was deemed somewhat naive, emphasizing the importance of effective communication over rigid timelines. Design decisions evolved, leveraging individual strengths and adapting to challenges. While content with the current product, the team acknowledges room for improvement and plans post-delivery enhancements, aspiring for perfection in creating a kid-friendly, educational platform.
